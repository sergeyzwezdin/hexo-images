# hexo-images ![Publish on NPM](https://github.com/sergeyzwezdin/hexo-images/workflows/Publish%20on%20NPM/badge.svg?branch=master) ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hexo-images)

`hexo-images` is a plugin for Hexo static site generator that optimizes images for better website performance.

* **Resizes** images up to sizes that are convenient for web browsing size. You don't need to share 36-megapixel photos on the web ðŸ™ƒ
* **Compresses** images to make sure it loads as fast as possible. It uses the most efficient algorithms to compress the image.
* Creates **responsive images** to display the most important part of the image for mobile users.
* Creates **special-sized** images if needed. Special sizes for special cases ðŸ‘Œ
* Provides **tag helper** to generate responsive-oriented picture tag.
* Generates `webp` files in addition to original image type.
* Converts old good GIFs to to `mp4` and `webm`. 

## How it works

1. Near to your `.md` file create folder with the same name as the `.md` file. Copy all required images there.

2. Run [`hexo generate`](https://hexo.io/docs/commands#generate) or [`hexo server`](https://hexo.io/docs/commands#server). The images will be processed and cached. Second run will not cause processing this image again. If image changes, the cache will be cleared and the image re-processed. This step could take a time, so be patient ðŸ˜‰

3. Once processing is done, the result files will be stored in special folder (`/.images/`) and included into the cache manifest (`/.images/images.json`). You should not care about the folder structure in this folder, but if you're curious it looks like this.

4. The processed files will be included into output build while running `hexo generate` or `hexo server`. To include it into the post use `{% picture %}` tag helper in the following way:
```markdown
Some text

{% picture 1.jpg %}
{% endpicture %}

Some other text
```

5. Responsive-oriented `picture` tag will be generated in the final output:

```html
<figure>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="/2014/fronttalks-2014/d5ea4373/1@1x.webp" media="(max-width: 39.99em)" type="image/webp" />
        <source srcset="/2014/fronttalks-2014/d5ea4373/1@2x.webp" media="(min-width: 40em)" type="image/webp" />
        <source srcset="/2014/fronttalks-2014/d5ea4373/1@1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 39.99em)" type="image/jpg" />
        <source srcset="/2014/fronttalks-2014/d5ea4373/1@2x.jpg" media="(min-width: 40em)" type="image/jpg" />
        <img src="/2014/fronttalks-2014/d5ea4373/1@2x.jpg" />
    </picture>
</figure>
```
